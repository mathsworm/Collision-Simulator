# Collision-Simulator

### Input specifications
The listCollisions function takes 5 arguments.
1. M: The list of masses of the particles. 
2. x: The list of x coordinates of the particles. 
3. v: The list of velocities of the particles. 
4. m: The maximum number of collisions upto which the simulation should be carried out. 
5. T: The time upto which the simulation should be carried out. 

### Output specifications

The output is a list, each element of which has three entries, the time of the collision, the particle which collides with the next particle, and the position (x coordinate) where this collision happens.
