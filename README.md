# Collision-Simulator
Simulates elastic collisions in 1D efficiently

The listCollisions function takes 5 arguments.
- M: The list of masses of the particles. 
- x: The list of x coordinates of the particles. 
- v: The list of velocities of the particles. 
- m: The maximum number of collisions upto which the simulation should be carried out. 
- T: The time upto which the simulation should be carried out.
